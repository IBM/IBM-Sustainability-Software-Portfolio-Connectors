# IBM TAS Connector for Envizi

The **IBM TAS Connector for Envizi** is released under the name "TAS Connector for Envizi". This connector supports the following capabilities through an App Connect flow:

-Automatically sync space and occupancy data from TAS with Envizi to enable energy usage calculations across entire facility portfolio with advanced analytics by location, by SQF, and by occupant.

***

## Use Case Examples

Corporate sustainability managers can gather and maintain accurate sustainability data for their entire global real estate portfolio directly from TAS where those facilities are managed. Location data from TAS serves as a baseline for all other Sustainability reports in Envizi; space classification, floor space, and headcount data allows Sustainability managers to normalize data (by square meter, or by employee) to enable meaningful comparisons between buildings across the entire portfolio to identify opportunities to reduce environmental impact.

***

## Connector Architecture

**IBM App Connect** provides a flexible environment for integration solutions to transform, enrich, route, and process business messages and data. 

**App Connect Flows** enable specific integration use cases by connecting to predefined APIs to route and map data. Mapping has been pre-defined, but it can be customized.

**Native API framework** is used for TAS and enabled thorugh provided packages that can be imported.

## Part 2: TAS Configuration

### Step 1: Initial TAS Configuration

#### Import OM Package

Go to **Tools -> Administration -> Object Migration** and select **New Import Package**. Select the OM Package labeled *APIConnector* into the TAS instance. In the pop-up window, select **Validate** to validate that the package can be imported properly and then **Import** to start the import process

Please refer to the [IBMÂ® TAS documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tap/3.6.1?topic=objects-object-migration-overview ) for more information on Object Migration.

#### TAS API User Access

In order for App Connect to be able to use TAS APIs, it will need a user with certain permissions. These user's credentials will be configured in App Connect.

1. Create an integration user by following the steps given in [Chapter 2](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSFCZ3_11.2/pdf/pdf_tri_app_admin.pdf). This user should be a non-admin user and not part of the Admin security group.

- Assign that user to a new or existing group for the integration. If you need to create a new security group, follow the steps given in [Chapter 1](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSFCZ3_11.2/pdf/pdf_tri_app_admin.pdf).

- Add the "TAS Base License" to the **License Details** section on the user Profile.

- Select the newly created group or desired existing group and switch to the **Access** tab and add the appropriate access for the integration.

- Add the permissions below for the new user's group:

  | Module        |     Business Object     |     Permissions    |
  |---------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
  | Location      |     triBuilding         |     Read           |
  | triAPIConnect |     triAPICTimestamp    | Read and Update    |

 
The user will now be able to interact with the proper TAS Modules.

#### Minimum requirements

For users to pull from these URLs, the minimum requirements are:

URL | Requirement
--|--
GET /oslc/spq/triAPICOutboundBuildingQC  | READ access to triBuilding Business object
GET /oslc/spq/triAPICTimeStampQC  | READ access to triAPICTimestamp Business Object 
POST /oslc/so/triAPICTimeStampRS/<ID> | Write access to triAPICTimestamp Business Object 

### Step 2: Group Name Configuration

The following steps outline the necessary configurations for the Envizi Group Name Configuration page.

#### Data Modeler

1. Go to **Tools -> Builder Tools -> Data Modeler** and using the Object Browser navigate to **Location->triBuilding**.

2. Revise the BO and add four fields: **cstEnviziParentOneTX**, **cstEnviziParentTwoTX**,

<img width="512" alt="Data Modeler Fields" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/3ddd5780-09b5-11ed-9014-fbd85b21e6eb">

Name and Label should be the following:

Name | Label
--|--
cstEnviziParentOneTX | Envizi Group 1
cstEnviziParentTwoTX | Envizi Group 2
cstEnviziParentThreeTX | Envizi Group 3
cstEnviziGroupNamePathTX | Envizi Path

After entering these values, click **Publish** to publish the BO

- Click **Save**. Logout and Login again to the system

#### Using the Integration

This tool will allow user to make changes on this new Envizi group name fields. But we must consider the existing records too. If you want those records to be populated, there is a patch helper workflow that can handle that.

The first thing that must be defined is which fields will be used to populate groups 1, 2 and 3 to be used on Envizi. To access the Envizi tool, go to **Tools -> System Setup -> Integration -> Envizi Integation**.

When you open the page, the fields will be displayed as Group1/Group2/Group3. By default the values are World Region/Country/City. The field Envizi Hierarchy Path shows how the Envizi groupnames will be configured according to the selected option. 

Enable Envizi checkbox is available too. The Envizi tab will be displayed only when this checkbox is marked

One more item that must be configured is the Number of levels to be used on the Envizi configuration. Envizi hierarchy path will match this selection.

<img width="900" alt="How-to-use" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/46f543c2-d118-4c98-8445-ed3e945d5dae">

Also, notice that there is a section named **Active/Retire with missing data** and **Draft/Revision with Missing Data**. This section will list the buildings that donât have data defined for Envizi group 3, so it means that no Envizi group will be populated on those buildings.

You can filter to change only the desired records by changing query **cst -triBuilding -Query -Get All Buildings for envizi**. The list of buildings displayed on this query will be the list of buildings that the patch helper will modify.

To use the tool, just select the desired Envizi group names and click **Save**. On the moment Save is triggered, all buildings will be populated with the desired options. This process may take a few minutes depending on how many buildings you have on your system. After that Envizi groups and path will be updated according to the selections made on Envizi Integration page.

<img width="900" alt="How-to-use-2" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/27c34480-3a95-11ed-9dc8-b6347de21bee">

Also, every time a building is saved and there are changes on the defined fields, or a new building is created, the Envizi groups and path will be modified according to the selected options. You can find the groups on tab Envizi on the building record

## Operating the Connector

#### On-demand Flow

This flow is for the initial sync or to sync data that was added/updated between specific dates. This flow is meant to be executed just once whenever needed and then stopped.

1. The following parameters in the initial **Set variable** node need to be configured in order to use this flow:
![Set variable configuration](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/06799700-0932-11ed-90c4-5842714c7033)
*Override Dates in Set Variable*

Parameter | Value
--|--
OverrideFromDate | The start timestamp of the window between which the data will be pulled from. e.g., `2022-06-26T23:09:30-07:00`
OverrideToDate | The end timestamp of the window between which the data will be pulled from. e.g., `2023-06-26T23:09:30-07:00`

<i>**These dates must be specified in ISO 8601 format**</i>


#### Always-On Flow
This flow is to keep syncing the data after the initial sync. This flow is meant to be kept running and will only sync the data that has been added or updated after its previous execution event. For example, if the flow executes at 2 PM and it's previous execution was at 1 PM, the flow will pull data that has been added or updated after 1 PM.

#### Configuring the Flow Parameters

1. Click on the initial **Set variable** node
![Set variable configuration](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/06799700-0932-11ed-90c4-5842714c7033)
*Fields in the initial Set variable node*

- In **Variable -> config -> customer**, enter the value provided by Envizi
- In **Variable -> config -> triURL**, enter URL for the TAS instance. (e.g., https://example.com:9080)


### Starting and Stopping the flow

1. Click on the kebab menu (three dots) on either the flow's tile or the specific flow page.
<img width="656" alt="Flow start 1" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/5be4ac00-eb1b-11ec-85b0-b7b2d400a7e1">
*Start the flow from the dashboard*
<img width="959" alt="Flow start 2" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/5be4ac00-eb1b-11ec-93f2-4031220e144f">
*Start the flow from the page*

- Click on **Start API** or **Stop API** depending on which action is desired.

## Part 3: Testing

A good way to test the TAS Outbound connectivity is to use the *Always_On* flow.

1. Start the *Always_On* flow and add a test building in the system.
- If configured correctly, the integration should pick up this change and deliver a .csv file with just that test building.

See [below](#common-errors-that-arise-from-tririga) for any errors that arise in App Connect.

## Troubleshooting

### Common errors that arise from TAS
 
The below errors are found in the App Connect logs.

 Error | Cause | Resolution
 -- |-- |--
 404 - The HTTP request returned with an error 404 "Not Found" | Incorrect App Connect connector config | Double check that the credentials being used in the HTTP post node in App Connect are correct
 401 - Authorization error | Too many user sessions open in TAS | Open the Admin dashboard on the TAS environment and check the Users logged in. This issue can arise after a number of requests are made to TAS and then gives a 401 error even with the proper credentials. Clear the users logged in and the issue should clear.
 
 - If these do not resolve the issue, try clearing the OSLC Cache in TAS Admin Console in case the integrations do not work in intended manner.
 


## Reference for Pre-requisite

### TAS Certificates

> **Note** If you have not already done so, please import App Connect Cert to TAS to enable encrypted communication. Provide the Cert from App Connect as a secret to the instance of TAS as such:

```
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: truststore-mgr.ibm.com/v1
kind: Truststore
metadata:
    name: my-tas-truststore
spec:
    license:
        accept: true
    includeDefaultCAs: true
    servers:
    - "example.com:443"
    certificates:
    - alias: alias_1 
      crt: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ...
        Certificate 1   
        ...
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

        ...

    - alias: alias_n 
      crt: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ...
        Certificate n   
        ...
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
EOF        

```
This must then be added as the truststore to the TAS instance. In the Custom Resource Definition for TAS, update the `spec.integration.truststore` field to reference the name of the created truststore. If there already is a truststore for TAS, update the Truststore resource to include the certificate with an additional alias.
