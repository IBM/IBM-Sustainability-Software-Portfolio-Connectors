# TRIRIGA - Maximo Connector

The **TRIRIGA - Maximo Connector** is released in TAS under the name *"TAS Connector for Maximo"* and in MAS under the name *"MAS Connector for TRIRIGA"*. 
This connector supports the following capabilities through a collection of App Connect flows:

- Bi-directional loading, and continuous synchronization of portfolio data such as People, Locations and Assets.
- Bi-directional routing of service requests between TRIRIGA and Maximo
- Automatic shadowing of TRIRIGA Work Tasks with Maximo Work Orders to enable Facility teams to do planing, budgeting and project management in TRIRIGA while work tasks get reflected in Maximo as Work Orders for execution.

***
## Use case examples
   
   1. TRIRIGA is the system of record for People and Space data while Maximo is the system of record for Assets. The Maintenance team wants consistent reports across the entire organization and more streamlined operations. The Spaces flows provided can be used to bulk-load all Spaces data from TRIRIGA into Maximo Locations, and then continuously keep the data in sync as it gets updated in TRIRIGA by a Facility Management team. This can apply to Assets, or People data in both directions. 
   2. Employees use TRIRIGA Request Central to submit a Service Request for a broken elevator. Since elevators are maintained in Maximo, the flow will create a corresponding Service Request in Maximo that will be assigned to technicians and resolved. As the Maximo Service Request gets updated, the changes are automatically reflected in the TRIRIGA Service request so the originator of the request remains informed of its status. This flow can operate in reverse as well if a Service Request originates from Maximo against a maintenance operation that should be tracked in TRIRIGA.
   3. Facility Management team have a capital project in TRIRIGA to upgrade all the lights to LEDs. The project has the budget, scope and tasks already defined. The flow can then create corresponding Work Orders in Maximo for each task to get executed by technicians using the Maximo Manage and Mobile applications. As the tasks get updated in Maximo, those updates flow back into TRIRIGA to reflect in the project plan.

## Connector architecture
**IBM App Connect** provides a flexible environment for integration solutions to transform, enrich, route, and process business messages and data.Â 

**App Connect Flows** enable specific integration use cases by connecting to predefined APIs to route and map data. Mapping has been pre-defined, but it can be customized.

**Native API framework** is used for Maximo and TRIRIGA and enabled thorugh provided packages that can be imported.

## Part 1. Configure App Connect

### App Connect Authentication

*Access to an instance of App Connect with a deployed instance of a Designer is required.* 

1. Two accounts need to be created from the **Catalog** tab in order to connect the applications. Once all of the connectors have loaded, type in **http** to find the HTTP Application.
 
2. If this is the first account, select **Connect** to begin setting up the initial HTTP account. If this is not the first account, make sure to take note if there are any other generic account names present because the number of the one created will depend on what has already been created. App Connect creates an account with a generic name in sequential order (Example: if Account 1 and Account 2 are present, the new account will be Account 3).

3. Use the below table to associate the proper credentials for the accounts.
4. Once the account is connected, head back to the HTTP Application on the Catalog page and rename the new account according to the Account Name column in the table below.

Flow | Account Name | Username | Password | API key | API location | API key name
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Max -> Tri | mxtririga | Your TRIRIGA Username | Your TRIRIGA Password | N/A | N/A | N/A
Tri -> Max | trimaximo | N/A | N/A | Your Maximo apikey | header | apikey

### Importing App Connect Flows

1. Locate the .yaml files for the desired flows from the provided zip.
2. Import the Selected Flows into **App Connect Enterprise**, or **App Connect SaaS on IBM Cloud** using the instructions below


#### Import Steps (App Connect Enterprise)

  1. From the App Connect Dashboard, click **New** and select **Import Flow** from the drop down menu.
  2. Either drag and drop or select the flow for import. In this example, the MX2TRI Person flow will be used.
  3. The flow should now be uploaded onto the App Connect instance. From this screen navigate using the **Edit flow** button to see the individual nodes of this flow. Be sure to select the HTTP account that was configured for Maximo to TRIRIGA for the connector. 
  4. Click **Done** on the top right of the screen then click on the three dots in the top right corner and select **Start API**.
  5. Go to the **Test** tab once it shows that the flow is **Running** and select the **POST** option on the left side of the screen. Click on **Try It** and grab the URL and security credentials from this screen for the next step.

  *Step 5: Try It*

#### Import Steps (App Connect SaaS)
  1. If your instance of AppConnect is through the cloud, your page will look a bit different.
  2. The interface is mostly the same, but instead of **Try It** you'll see a tab called **Manage**. This page contains a few important pieces of information that you'll need to complete the configuration. First, at the top of the page under **API Info** you'll see a field called **Route**. Piece this together with the correct path of the flow that you're implementing in order to create the proper flow URL.
  3. Collect the API key at the bottom of the page from a field called **Sharing outside of Cloud Foundry organization**. Click on **Create API key and documentation link**. Provide a name and it will generate an apikey for you to use with this flow along with a documentation link that looks like the **Test** page from the on-prem configuration.
  4. The end of the URL at the top of the page should have the path that will complete the route URL. Copy the end of the URL that begins with **tri** and add it to the piece gathered earlier. The 6 character string that precedes the path on the documentation should match the last 6 characters of the route piece from before.

## Part 4: Testing

To test that the configuration is complete, send a test payload in order to test connectivity.

### Maximo
1. Go to the **End Points** application and click **Test** at the bottom of the integration you would like to test.
- Send a test payload that is a valid object. ```{"Hello":"World"}``` would work.
- If the response is anything other than **Bad Request**, see [what might be causing the error](#testing-the-end-point)

### TRIRIGA
Use a tool like POSTMan to test the connectivity of the App Connect flow. You can use a Sample JSON Payload from this [open source repository](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api). 

## Troubleshooting

Depending on the direction of the flow, cross-referencing errors from two systems can help identify the root cause of an issue with the integration. For example:
 
 - If there is a Not Found error in Maximo Message Reprocessing when running the flow, double check the logs in App Connect to see if there is a corresponding error. If there is, the root cause might be related to what is being sent out of Maximo. If there isn't, then the message never left Maximo and the flow should be checked to make sure it is running.
 
### Common errors that arise from Maximo
 
#### Testing the End Point
 
When testing that the end point is entered correctly on the **End Points** application, there are two common errors:

Error | Cause | Resolution
 -- |-- |--
Response code received from the HTTP request from the endpoint is not successful | Invalid URL in the Integration Object | Double check the URL that all of the components are entered correctly. Make sure there are no accidental spaces at the beginning or the end in event of a copy/paste.
404: Not Found | Flow is not Running | Make sure the flow is Running before starting the cron tasks
PKSync error| Certificate error | Confirm the certificate is configured correctly
 
#### Message Reprocessing

Errors in Maximo can be found in **Message Reprocessing**

 Error | Cause | Resolution
 -- |-- |--
Bad Request error | Either the payload being sent out is incorrect or the account configurations are wrong |Double check to make sure the Accounts from the App Connect pre-requisite section are correct and that the item in Maximo has all of the mapped fields

### Common errors that arise from TRIRIGA
 
 Error | Cause | Resolution
 -- |-- |--
 404 - Not Found: Cannot POST | Invalid URL in the Integration Object | Double check the URL in the specific Integration Object that all of the components are entered correctly
 404 - API doesn't exist | Flow is not running | Double check that the flow is Active in App Connect
 404 - The HTTP request returned with an error 404 "Not Found" | Incorrect App Connect connector config | Double check that the credentials being used in the HTTP post node in App Connect are correct
 
 - Clear OSLC Cache in TRIRIGA Admin Console in case the integrations do not work in intended manner.
 


## Reference for Pre-requisite

### **Pre-requisite: add an App Connect Certificate in MAS 8.9+**

1. Extract the App Connect certificate from an imported flow URL. Navigate to the flow's page and click on **Test** and then **Try It** to get the proper URL.

2. Navigate to the Admin dashboard for MAS and go to the workspace where Manage is deployed.


3. Update the configuration and scroll down to **Imported Certificates**. Untick the **System managed** button and fill in the extracted certificate in the fields.


4. Click **Apply Changes** at the top of the page and MAS will update the truststore with the new certificate.

*Step 3: Imported Certificates*

### Pre-requisite: add an App Connect Certificate in Maximo 7.6.1.2+:


Configure WebSphere Certificates. This makes a test connection to a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) port and retrieves the signer from the server during the handshake.

1. Log into the WebSphere console that is hosting the Maximo server.

2. Click on **Security** -> **SSL certificate & key management**. Under **Related Items** click on **Key stores and certificates**.

3. Click on **CellDefaultTrustStore** and on the next page under **Additional Properties** click on **Signer certificates**. 

4. From this page, click on the button that says **Retrieve from Port** and fill in the required fields using the table below:

    Field | Value
    ---|---
    Host | The host from the imported flow URL
    Port | 443
    Alias | appconnect

5. Once all three have been entered in, click **Retrieve signer information** and the information from the URL will populate on screen. Click **Save** in the box at the top and then repeat the process for **NodeDefaultTrustStore**.
