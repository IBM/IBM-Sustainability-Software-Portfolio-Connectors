# TRIRIGA - Maximo Connector

The **TRIRIGA - Maximo Connector** is released in TAS under the name *"TAS Connector for Maximo"* and in MAS under the name *"MAS Connector for TRIRIGA"*. 
This connector supports the following capabilities through a collection of App Connect flows:

- Bi-directional loading, and continuous synchronization of portfolio data such as People, Locations and Assets.
- Bi-directional routing of service requests between TRIRIGA and Maximo
- Automatic shadowing of TRIRIGA Work Tasks with Maximo Work Orders to enable Facility teams to do planing, budgeting and project management in TRIRIGA while work tasks get reflected in Maximo as Work Orders for execution.

***
## Use case examples
   
   1. TRIRIGA is the system of record for People and Space data while Maximo is the system of record for Assets. The Maintenance team wants consistent reports across the entire organization and more streamlined operations. The Spaces flows provided can be used to bulk-load all Spaces data from TRIRIGA into Maximo Locations, and then continuosly keep the data in sync as it gets updated in TRIRIGA by a Facility Management team. This can apply to Assets, or People data in both directions. 
   2. Employees use TRIRIGA Request Central to submit a Service Request for a broken elevator, since elevators are maintained in Maximo, the flow will create a corresponding Service Request in Maximo that will be assigned to technicians and resolved. As the Maximo Service Request gets updated, the changes are automatically reflected in the TRIRIGA Service request so the originator of the request remains informed of its status. This flow can operate in reverse as well if a Service Request originates from Maximo against a maintenance operation that should be tracked in TRIRIGA.
   3. Facility Management team have a capital project in TRIRIGA to upgrade all the lights to LEDs. The project has the budget,  scope and tasks already defined. The flow can then create corresponding Work Orders in Maximo for each task to get executed by technicians using the Maximo Manage and Mobile applications. As the tasks get updated in Maximo, those updates flow back into TRIRIGA to reflect in the project plan.

## Connector architecture
**IBM App Connect** provides a flexible environment for integration solutions to transform, enrich, route, and process business messages and data.Â 

**App Connect Flows** enable specific integration use cases by connecting to predefined APIs to route and map data. Mapping has been pre-defined, but it can be customized.

**Native API framework** is used for Maximo and TRIRIGA and enabled thorugh provided packages that can be imported.

## Part 1. Installing the Right Flows into App Connect 

### App Connect Authentication

>Access to an instance of App Connect with a deployed instance of a Designer is required. This code pattern has been tested with App Connect version 3.0. 

1. Two accounts need to be created from the **Catalog** tab in order to connect the applications. Once all of the connectors have loaded, type in **http** to find the HTTP Application.
 
2. If this is the first account, select **Connect** to begin setting up the initial HTTP account. If this is not the first account, make sure to take note if there are any other generic account names present because the number of the one created will depend on what has already been created. App Connect creates an account with a generic name in sequential order (Example: if Account 1 and Account 2 are present, the new account will be Account 3).

3. Use the below table to associate the proper credentials for the accounts.
4. Once the account is connected, head back to the HTTP Application on the Catalog page and rename the new account according to the Account Name column in the table below.

Flow | Account Name | Username | Password | API key | API location | API key name
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Max -> Tri | mxtririga | Your TRIRIGA Username | Your TRIRIGA Password | N/A | N/A | N/A
Tri -> Max | trimaximo | N/A | N/A | Your Maximo apikey | header | apikey
